# MiniSys - Implementation of a Mini Computing System

Implementation of a mini computing system over a well-defined language named LM. This project is based in the development of the following modules: a macroprocessor for allowing high level programming through pseudocode, an assembler (S2) for the language, a linker (L2) for assembled modules and a simulator (M2) for the executable file.
