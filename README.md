# MiniSys - Mini Computing System

Implementation of a mini computing system over a well-defined language named LM. This project is based on the development of the following modules: a macroprocessor (GNU M4) for allowing high level programming through pseudocode, an assembler (S2) for the language, a linker (L2) for assembled modules and a simulator (M2) for the executable file.

Read the [doc](doc/doc.pdf) and the [spec](doc/spec.pdf) for more information on the project.
